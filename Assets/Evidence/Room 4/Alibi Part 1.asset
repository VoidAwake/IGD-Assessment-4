  dialogue: "Mornin' Detective. The name's Rob.\nI won't lie, it's been a long day
    driving back and forth between errands.\nSo, I got up in the morning to drive
    my pal Joe, down to work a bit after 10AM, he'd have gotten into the office at
    around 12PM. \nTakes almost exactly 2 hours back and forth y'know, long drive.
    \nI went to work directly after that and got home at 7:00PM, I think Tim was
    the only one at home with Henry at the time.\nI had a good choice of parking
    spaces though, the car park was empty when I got back. Usually Henry nabs my
    parking spot before I get back home, thank god Joe just carpools with me. \nI
    wouldn't be able to stand it if I had ANOTHER person fighting with me over my
    parking spots...\nAnyway, I took a nap before driving off to grab Fred from the
    airport. Must've been nice to take a holiday...\nBy the time we got back from
    the airport it was 1AM. Fred saw the door to Henry's room ajar, so he pushed
    it open and, well, the rest is history."
