  dialogue: "Mornin' Detective. The name's Rob.\nI won't lie, it's been a long day
    driving back and forth between errands.\nFirst thing in the morning I drove my
    friend Joe down to work a bit after 10AM.\nI went to work directly after that
    and got home at 7:00PM, I think Tim was the only one at home with Henry at the
    time.\nThe car park was empty when I got back. Henry is the only other resident
    here who has a car, so he was obviously off somewhere.\nProbably brought some
    trouble back home with him in my opinion...\nAnyway, I took a nap before driving
    off to grab Fred from the airport at 11PM. \nBy the time we got back it was 1AM.
    Fred saw the door to Henry's room ajar, so he pushed it open and, well, the rest
    is history."
