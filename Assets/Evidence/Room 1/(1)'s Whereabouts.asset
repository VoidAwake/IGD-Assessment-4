  description: (1)'s Whereabouts
  dialogue: '(1) had been on a holiday for 2 days and only got back the day after
    the victim had died.

    This is confirmed by (4).

    Speaking of which (1)
    and (4) were the ones who found the victim''s body.

    If I recall they found
    the body when they opened the door, what were they doing there?'
