  dialogue: "It's great to meet you Detective, though I wish it were under better
    circumstances... I can't say I was present for much of this when it all went
    down, but I'll try to help as much as I can.\nRob- that'll be my friend in room
    four, drove me to work in the morning. \nWhen I got home at around 10:30PM I
    saw Tim up and about in the hallway, he looked quite startled upon seeing me.
    Gave me a good scolding too...\nIt's been a long day at work, fell asleep soon
    after so I don't know when Rob and Fred got back after Rob picked Fred up from
    the airport."
