  dialogue: "It's great to meet you Detective, though I wish it were under better
    circumstances... \nI can't say I was present for much of this when it all went
    down, I was at work the entire day.\nI work as a security guard, in fact I'm
    still scrolling through some security footage from work.\nAnyways, I got a ride
    to work from my pal Rob down in room four this morning.\nBy the time I got home
    at around 10:30PM I saw Tim up and about in the hallway, he looked quite startled
    upon seeing me. Gave me a good scolding too.\nIt's been a long day at work, I
    fell asleep soon after getting home."
