  dialogue: 'G''day, detective. The body''s already been taken away, but the autopsy
    report is in. We''ve estimated the time of death to be 8:30PM last night.

    Victim''s
    body was covered in bloody bruises, and there was a rope lesion around his neck
    from hanging from the ceiling.

    Not likely to be a suicide, in my opinion.
    The bruises look like he went down fighting.

    That said, the cause of death
    was determined to be strangulation.

    The body was found at 1AM by the residents
    of rooms one and four.'
