  dialogue: "G\'day, detective. The body\'s already been taken away, but the autopsy
    report is in. We've estimated the time of death to be 8:30PM last night.\nVictim\'s body was covered in bloody bruises, and there
    was a rope lesion around his neck from hanging from the ceiling.\nNot likely to
    be a suicide, in my opinion. The bruises look like he went down fighting.\nThat said, the cause of death was determined
    to be strangulation.\nThe body was found at 1AM by the residents of rooms one and four."
