  dialogue: "Good -- {yawn} Sorry. Good morning detective. My name's Tim, but everyone
    calls me Sleepy Tim./n I'm sorry for my appearance, but I've been woken up enough
    times this morning.\nI was home all of yesterday. I decided to get to bed at
    6PM.\nI got woken up by some loud noises at 10:30PM. Saw two cars outside so
    I figured it must be Joe back from work. He usually gets back around that time.
    So I went out to have a go at whoever it was for causing a ruckus so late.\nWent
    outside and saw Joe from room three, I figured it must've been him, since he
    usually get's back around that time. Usually a bit earlier though, more like
    10:00PM.\nThere's only one thing that I don't get. Everyone's saying Fred's been
    off on holidays, but I heard him break two of his pots yesterday morning, just
    one after the other.\n  And now if you'll excuse me detective, I've got some
    sleep to catch up on. Try to keep it down, will you?"
