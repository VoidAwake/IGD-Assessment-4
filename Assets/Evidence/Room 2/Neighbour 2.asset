  dialogue: "Good -- {yawn} Sorry. Good morning detective. My name's Tim, but everyone
    calls me Sleepy Tim.\nSorry if I'm a bit crabby, but I've been woken up enough
    times this morning.\nI was home all of yesterday. I decided to get to bed at
    6PM, but I got woken up by some loud noises at 10:30PM.\nFigured it must be Joe from room three coming back from work. He usually gets back at 10:00PM but I guess there was traffic or something.\nSo I went out and saw Joe in the hallway,
    gave him a bit of a talking to for making noise so late and went back to bed.\nThere's only one thing that I don't get. Everyone's saying Fred's been
    off on holidays, but I heard him break two of his pots yesterday morning, 
    one after the other.\nAnyway, I got woken up again at 12:50AM when I heard someone faint. Didn't get me out of bed though.\nNow if you'll excuse me detective, I've got some
    sleep to catch up on. Try to keep it down, will you?"
